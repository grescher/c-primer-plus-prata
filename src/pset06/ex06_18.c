//  Professor Rabnud joined a social media group. Initially he had five
//  friends. He noticed that his friend count grew in the following fashion.
//  The first week one friend dropped out and the remaining number of friends
//  doubled. The second week two friends dropped out and the remaining number
//  of friends doubled. In general, in the Nth week, N friends dropped out
//  and the remaining number doubled. Write a program that computes and
//  displays the number of friends each week. The program should continue
//  until the count exceeds Dunbarâ€™s number.
